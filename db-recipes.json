Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\r\n\r\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",

Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.\r\n\r\nPat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nRoll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.\r\n\r\nBrush biscuit tops with melted butter.

Place the honey, liquid glucose, water and sugar in a large heavy-based saucepan and heat gently, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and cook until the mixture starts to turn a light golden colour. Mix in the baking soda. The mixture will erupt into a foaming mass. Pour immediately into the prepared baking tray.\r\n\r\n2. Leave to cool, then place in the fridge to set. This takes approx 6-10 mins. Break up with the end of a rolling pin and store in an airtight jar if not using immediately.\r\n\r\n3. Using a blender, blitz the raspberries and blueberries together with little caster sugar until smooth. Add a drop of lavender essence. Strain the mixture through a sieve to create a fresh coulis. Taste to check consistency and flavour, add a spoonful of water or sugar as necessary.\r\n\r\n4. Lightly mix almost all of the honeycomb through the yoghurt. Spoon into individual serving glasses and pour the coulis on top. Garnish with lavender flowers and a sprinkling of the remaining honeycomb. Serve immediately.",

        "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350F. Make the cake: butter three 9-inch round cake pans, and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Sift flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and 1 1\/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of a mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined. Raise speed to medium and add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Divide batter among pans. Bake until cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks and let cool completely.\r\n\r\n3. Make the caramel: Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring, until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat, and carefully pour in cream (mixture will bubble violently); stir until smooth. Return to heat, and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238F, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Let cool completely.\r\n\r\n4. Meanwhile, make the frosting: whisk together cocoa and warm water in a bowl until cocoa dissolves. Beat butter, confections' sugar, and a generous pinch of coarse salt in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in melted chocolate and then cocoa mixture until combined. Let stand for 30 minutes before using.\r\n\r\n5. Trim tops of cakes using a serrated knife to creat a level surface. Cut each in half horizontally to form 2 layers. Transfer 1 layer to a serving platter and spread 3\/4 cup caramel over top. Top with another cake layer, and repeat with remaining caramel and cake layers, leaving top uncovered. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\n6. Frost top and sides of cake in a swirling motion. Sprinkle with sea salt.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: Caramel can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using. Cake layers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days (they actually taste better when refrigerated and have a better texture for stacking).\r\n\r\nStorage: Frosted cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.",

In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt.\r\n\r\nAdd the orange juice and brandy to mixer and mix well.\r\n\r\nSlowly incorporate the flour cup by cup until the mixture forms a dough that is not too loose but not quite firm either. It will be dense and wet but not sticky. Once the flour is incorporated fully stop mixing.\r\n\r\nTo roll cookies, pinch a portion of dough off about the size of a walnut. Shape in your palms into a smooth oblong shape, almost like a small egg. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Shape and roll cookies until the sheet is filled.\r\n\r\nPress the tines of a large fork in a crosshatch pattern in the center of each cookie. This will flatten them slightly in the center. The cookies should resemble lightly flattened ovals when they go in the oven.\r\n\r\nBake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 25 \u2013 30 minutes until lightly browned.

Bring the mixture to a boil then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon, cloves, and lemon rind and stir in lemon juice.\r\n\r\nPlace the ground walnuts in a shallow plate or bowl next to the stove top. When the cookies come out of the oven and while they are still very warm, carefully float the cookies in the syrup and allow the cookies to absorb syrup on both sides.\r\n\r\nUsing a fork or small spatula, remove the cookie from the syrup and place on a platter or plate.

Depending on how they are folded (see below), they can be baked or fried. They are holiday tradition on the Greek island of Crete, but eaten at other times as well because they're so delicious! These call for the fresh soft variety of myzithra (not the aged salty type) cheese, and if you can't find it, try Italian mascarpone or ricotta.",

Lightly grease a baking sheet.\r\n\r\nMake the pastry\r\n\r\nOn a floured surface with a rolling pin, roll a piece of dough out to a thickness of about 1\/8th of an inch. Using a 3-4 inch cutter or saucer as a guide, cut out circles. (Alternatively, take a piece of dough the size of an unshelled walnut and roll it out to a circle about 3-4 inches across.)\r\n\r\nPlace a spoonful of the cheese mixture into the center of the circle and spread out close to the edges. Raise the rim of the dough up around the cheese and, with wet fingers, pinch the edges to pull the dough in around the cheese, leaving the center open so the cheese shows.\r\n\r\nRepeat using all the dough and filling. Place the kalitsounia on the baking sheet and brush lightly with beaten egg to glaze. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for approximately 20 minutes until lightly browned (see photo). Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.\r\n\r\nAllow to cool on the baking sheet. Kalitsounia will keep well, covered, in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nTo fry\r\n\r\nPlace a teaspoonful of cheese mix into the center of the circle, fold the circle over into a half-moon shape. With wet fingers, crimp the edges to close securely. Preheat 1 cup of olive oil over medium heat and fry until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar or drizzle with honey.\r\n\r\nYield: 30-36 pieces",

Dough may be scooped into balls, wrapped well, and frozen for up to several months. For hot homemade cookies, FAST, simply place frozen dough balls on a baking sheet, and bake for a minute or so longer than the directions indicate. These cookies stay nice and fresh for a day or so after baking. Freeze for longer storage. To make sure your oven temperature is exactly right, bake a sample cookie first. If the cookie spreads too much, raise the oven temperature slightly. If it doesn't spread enough, lower the oven temperature slightly, or pat the dough down slightly before baking.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. Then we\u2019ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. When it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3\/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. Wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. Store in an airtight jar for several months.",

Reduce speed to low, and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with milk mixture, beginning and ending with flour.\r\n3. In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the whites into the cupcake batter. Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 batches.\r\n4. Divide batter among baking cups, filling each halfway full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean and the tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely in tins set on wire racks.\r\n5. Meanwhile, make the caramel: bring granulated sugar and water to a boil in a small high-sided saucepan, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-high, and cook until mixture just starts to turn pale gold around edges. Remove from heat, and immediately pour caramel onto a rimmed baking sheet. Working quickly, tilt pan to spread caramel to edges to make a very thin layer. Let cool to harden.\r\n6. Make the frosting: beat cream cheese and butter with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable.\r\n7. Frost each cupcake using an offset spatula. Twist pan to release and break caramel in order for it to resemble broken glass. Place a shard or 2 of caramel \"glass\" in the center of each cupcake. Drizzle or pipe cherry preserves where caramel has entered the cupcake.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: unfrosted cupcakes can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. Frosting can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. Caramel can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day, break just before using.\r\n\r\nStorage: frosted cupcakes can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\r\n\r\nChile rellenos: Mix the cheese and oregano in a small bowl. Cut a slit through 1 side of the charred chiles and fill each chile with 1\/4 cup of the cheese mixture. Close with toothpicks to hold the filling in place. In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat for about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don't have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Dredge the filled chiles in flour until fully covered. Shake off any excess flour, then dip the chiles into the egg mixture, until well coated. Fry until golden brown and drain on paper towels.\r\n\r\nArrange the chiles on a serving platter, spoon the sauce on top and serve.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nTo char the chiles (or any fresh chile): Put the chiles over a gas flame or underneath the broiler and cook until they are blackened on all sides. Enclose them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam, which will make them easier to peel. Peel, stem, and seed the chiles. Once peeled, the chiles may be chopped, sliced or stuffed.",

Add the milk, sour cream, egg yolk and 1\/2 cup flour; beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until combined. Gradually beat in the remaining 1 1\/4 cups flour, scraping the bowl as needed, to form a wet dough, about4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high; add the whole egg, sugar, salt and vanilla and beat until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time; beat until incorporated. The dough will be very wet.\r\n\r\nBrush a large bowl with butter; transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Stir the dough to punch it down; cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or up to overnight.\r\n\r\nGenerously dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Pat the dough into a square on the parchment, then roll into an 11-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the dough and parchment to a baking sheet and brush off the excess flour. Cover and chill until firm enough to shape, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, make the filling: Pulse the almonds and sugar in a food processor until fine. Add the butter, egg, rum, vanilla, cinnamon, orange zest and almond extract; pulse until smooth. Cover and chill 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMake the streusel: Mash the confectioners' sugar, flour and butter in a bowl with a fork to make clumps. Cover and chill until ready to use.\r\n\r\nButter an 8 1\/2-by-4 1\/2-inch loaf pan. Spread the almond filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border; sprinkle with the chocolate. Starting from a short side, use the parchment to tightly roll up the dough, brushing off the excess flour. Pinch the ends of the roll, then twist several times. Fold the twist in half so the ends meet. Twist the folded dough again and place in the pan. Cover with buttered parchment; let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 2 hours.\r\n\r\n***If desired, make up to this point 1 day in advance. Cover with buttered parchment, then wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Remove 1 hour before baking.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the loaf with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with the streusel. Bake until the bread is golden and springs back when pressed, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. Loosen with a knife, then let cool in the pan, 1 hour. Unmold onto a rack to finish cooling.",

Space the slices atop the filling.\r\n\r\n8) Fold one of the end pieces into the center to cover the bananas and filling.\r\n\r\n9) Spread the remaining filling atop the piece of dough you've just folded into the center, and distribute the dried pineapple evenly atop the filling.\r\n\r\n10) Fold the other side of the dough over the filling to cover it. Pull the long side seam underneath, and tuck each end underneath, too. You should have a long, flat log with no filling showing.\r\n\r\n11) Use a sharp knife to cut 4 diagonal slashes atop the loaf, cutting through both layers of dough; this will allow steam to escape.\r\n\r\n12) Brush with the beaten egg white, and sprinkle with the coarse or Demerara sugar.\r\n\r\n13) Cover the loaf gently with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 1 hour. It won't rise much, if at all. Towards the end of the resting period, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\r\n\r\n14) Bake the loaf in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes. Tent with foil, and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, till it's golden brown and a sharp knife poked into the center doesn't reveal any raw dough.\r\n\r\n15) Remove from the oven, and transfer to a rack to cool.\r\n\r\nYield: 1 large loaf, about 16 servings.",

        "instructions": "1) Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment.\r\n\r\n2) In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, coconut cream, salt, and coconut flavor, stirring till thoroughly combined.\r\n\r\n3) Add the coconut milk powder, stirring to combine.\r\n\r\n4) Drop the sticky mixture in ping pong-sized balls (about 1 1\/2\") onto the prepared baking sheets. It helps to use a tablespoon cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop here. For best results, pack the coconut mixture into the scoop; each ball should weigh about 1 ounce. You can space the balls fairly close together on the baking sheet; they only need about 3\/4\" to 1\" between them.\r\n\r\n5) Bake the macaroons for about 10 minutes; they won't brown. You may see the merest hint of brown on top.\r\n\r\n6) Remove from the oven, and cool completely on the baking sheet.\r\n\r\n7) To make the coating, heat the chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup until the chips are very soft. A microwave oven works well, as does a saucepan set over very low heat.\r\n\r\n8) Dip half of each cooled macaroon into the chocolate. Set the macaroons back on the baking sheet, and allow the chocolate to set completely before serving. To store, place in one layer in a closed container. They'll keep for 2 or 3 days, but will gradually become less moist as they sit.\r\n\r\nYield: 33 macaroons.\r\n\r\ntips from our bakers\r\nCoconut cream, sweetened condensed coconut milk, is the coconut equivalent of sweetened condensed milk. Substitute sweetened condensed milk, if desired.\r\nCoconut milk powder adds flavor and helps the macaroons hold their nice, smooth shape. Leave it out if you like.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 or 400 degrees F.\r\n\r\nBake the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check them!\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are still hot peel and pass them through a food mill or ricer. (I find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nWhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\nCrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nForm the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 1\/2-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!!\r\n\r\nUse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\nP.S. These are Chef Anne \"Secrets\" to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time.\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/anne-burrell\/gnocchi-with-prosciutto-spring-peas-and-chanterelles-recipe\/index.html?oc=linkback",

When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat pan.\r\n\r\n2 Add the shrimp, quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\r\n\r\n3 Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp.\r\n\r\n4 Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or saut\u00e9 pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.\r\n\r\n5 Drizzle the soy sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.",

        "instructions": "Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\r\n\r\nFilling: In a small pot, bring the chicken broth and cumin to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the couscous. Cover the pan until the couscous is tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes. Put the couscous in a large bowl and add the beans, currants, spinach, feta and 1\/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir until all the ingredients are combined.\r\n\r\nSlice the tops off the peppers and remove all the ribs and seeds. If necessary, cut a very thin slice from the base to help the peppers stand up. Stuff the peppers with the filling and drizzle the tops with olive oil. Put the peppers in an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish. Fill the baking dish with 3\/4-inch hot water and bake until the filling is golden and the peppers are cooked through, about 55 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nSauce: In a blender, combine the basil, creme fraiche, olive oil, water, garlic, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.\r\n\r\nRemove the peppers from the oven and arrange on serving plates. Spoon the sauce around the peppers and serve.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using slow-cooker, skip the chicken broth and add the dry couscous and cumin directly to the bowl with the rest of the filling.  Cook in the slow cooker for 4 hours on High.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using poblanos, instead preheat the oven to 475. Halve and clean the poblanos, cover in oil, salt, and pepper, and roast the halves for 11-13 minutes, until slightly softened. Remove from oven, but leave oven on.\r\n\r\nWhen filling is ready, pack into the poblano halves. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, until the peppers are softened. Remove from oven and let sit for two minutes, then drizzle with sauce and serve.",

Combine the cream cheese, sugar and flour in a small bowl, and mix until smooth. Add the egg yolk and flavoring (if using), mixing until smooth once again. Transfer the mixture to a disposable pastry bag, and cut just the very tip off the end, as shown.\r\n\r\n2. Place a small pool of the mixture in the center of the brownie batter. Draw circles around this pool, about 1 inch apart, moving out from the center each time.\r\n\r\n3. Once the circles are drawn, take a table knife, wet the tip, and draw it back and forth through the circles.\r\n\r\n4. The knife will draw the cream cheese filling into arcs, as you see here. Once you've gone all the way around the circles, take up your pastry bag again.\r\n\r\n5. Use the remaining filling to trace the path where the knife travelled, to create the spokes of the web.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, until the brownies just barely pull away from the edge of the pan. The center will rise while baking, but will sink back level once the brownies are cool.

Or simply combine the butter and sugar, and heat, stirring, until the butter is melted. Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110\u00b0F to 120\u00b0F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.\r\n\r\n4) Add the hot butter\/sugar mixture to the egg\/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.\r\n\r\n5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth. Note: If you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies, rather than melting in, let the batter cool in the bowl for about 20 minutes before stirring in the chips.\r\n\r\n6) Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan.\r\n\r\n7) Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it.

Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.\r\n\r\n2) To make the cookies: Combine the sugars, peanut butter, shortening, salt, baking soda, and vanilla, beating until smooth.\r\n\r\n3) Add the egg, beating to combine.\r\n\r\n4) Stir in the oats and flour.\r\n\r\n5) Drop the dough by the heaping teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 1\/2\" between them. A teaspoon cookie scoop works well here.\r\n\r\n6) Using the flat bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar, flatten each cookie to about 1\/4\" thickness, about 1 1\/2\" diameter. If you're a fan of the popular sweet\/salty flavor combo, sprinkle each cookie with the tiniest amount of extra-fine salt (or to taste; you know your own tolerance for saltiness).\r\n\r\n7) Bake the cookies for about 12 to 14 minutes, until they're a medium golden brown.\r\n\r\n8) Remove them from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool. Once they're cool, wrap airtight; they'll soften if left unwrapped.\r\n\r\n9) Decide which type of filling you want to use. Each recipe makes enough to fill all the cookies.\r\n\r\n10) To make the peanut butter filling: Mix all of the ingredients until smooth; a mini food processor works well here. If you're not using a food processor, sift the confectioners' sugar before stirring it together with the peanut butter and milk or half & half.\r\n\r\n11) To make the fudge filling: Combine the chocolate chips and half & half in a small, microwave-safe bowl; or in a small saucepan. Heat until the half & half is steaming. Remove from the heat, and stir until the chips have melted and the filling is smooth; reheat briefly if necessary.\r\n\r\n12) Spread the filling on half the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies.\r\n\r\nYield: about 22 filled cookies.",

Gently stir until the dough is evenly mixed; avoid overmixing.\r\n\r\nTransfer the biscuit dough to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough into a 9-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into 6 even strips in each direction, making 36 squares. Set the biscuits on the baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Bake until puffed and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack to cool.\r\n\r\nCut each biscuit in half horizontally. Cut the smoked salmon into strips about 1 inch wide and a few inches long. Stir together the creme fraiche and lemon zest in small bowl.\r\n\r\nTo assemble the biscuits, fold the salmon strips into 1 inch squares and set them on the bottom portions of the biscuits, add a dollop of the creme fraiche, and top with the other biscuit halves. Arrange the biscuits on a platter or tray and serve.\r\n\r\nMakes 36 biscuits.\r\n\r\nTo double, double all the ingredients, making the biscuits in batches.\r\nBest not to halve but you can cut the biscuits into 16 pieces for larger portions.\r\nYou can make the biscuits 1 day ahead and store in an airtight container; split and fill not more than 1 hour before serving.",

To avoid heating the chocolate too much and possibly burning it, the best method is to heat until the butter is melted and the chocolate has partially melted, then remove from the heat. Stir until all the chocolate melts.\r\n\r\n2. In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until they're thoroughly combined. Add the hot melted chocolate, then stir in the remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\n3. Refrigerate the batter-like dough until it's thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours (or overnight). It needs to set and stiffen up before it can be scooped into balls.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, three if you have them. Or line sheets with parchment, and grease the parchment.\r\n\r\n5. Drop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls (balls about 1\" across) onto the prepared baking sheets. A teaspoon cookie scoop makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2\" between the dough balls, as they'll spread as they bake.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the cookies for 10 to 11 minutes, until their tops are shiny and cracked. They won't crack until the very end, so keep a close eye on them; when they're cracked all the way across the top surface, they're just about done. The point is, you want these baked all the way through, but just barely; additional baking will make them crisp rather than chewy.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the cookies from the oven. After a few minutes, gently loosen them with a spatula, then let them finish cooling on the pan.\r\n\r\nYield: about 4 dozen 2\" cookies.",

Add the eggs and the vanilla and mix well. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix the dry ingredients into the batter with the mixer on low speed until just combined. Press the dough evenly into an ungreased 18 by 12 by 1-inch baking sheet, making an edge around the outside. It will be very sticky; sprinkle the dough and your hands lightly with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, until the crust is set but not browned. Allow to cool.\r\n\r\nFor the topping, combine the butter, honey, brown sugar, and zests in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over low heat until the butter is melted, using a wooden spoon to stir. Raise the heat and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the heavy cream and pecans. Pour over the crust, trying not to get the filling between the crust and the pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling is set. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold.

Set a small plate on top of the tofu and weigh it down with something heavy, like a 28oz can of tomatoes. Press for 15-30 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Cut the tofu pieces depending on how you plan to use it.\r\n\r\n3. Marinate the tofu (optional). Place marinade in a shallow dish and add tofu; toss. Place in the fridge for at least 30m and up to overnight.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the tofu: arrange the tofu on the baking sheet in a single layer. Try to avoid the pieces touching each other. Bake until the outside of the tofu is golden and the pieces look slightly puffed, 20 to 45 minutes depending on the size and shape of your tofu. Toss the tofu every 10 minutes so the pieces bake evenly. The longer you bake the tofu, the chewier it will be.\r\n\r\n7. Cool and store: if save the tofu for later, let it cool on the baking sheet, then transfer to a refrigerator container. The tofu will keep refrigerated for up to a week.\r\n\r\nMarinade:\r\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\r\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\r\n1 tablespoon rice vinegar\r\n1 tablespoon water\r\nOther marinade ideas: minced ginger, minced garlic, lemon or lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, barbecue sauce (thinned with water)\r\n\r\n1 tablespoon cornstarch, optional for crispy tofu (toss tofu in starch just before baking)",

Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and the basil and cook until thickened and the tomatoes soften and break down. season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nTransfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan, add the basil and chopped parsley, season with salt, pepper, and honey, if needed.\r\n\r\nFor the cauliflower sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the florets from the head of cauliflower and put in a small roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 1\/2 cups water to the bottom of the pan, cover with foil, and cook until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.\r\n\r\nMelt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in 4 cups of the milk, increase the heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a blender (in batches) and puree until smooth. Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan through a medium mesh strainer and bring to a simmer over low heat. Whisk in the nutmeg, cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook for 1 minute. Add some of the remaining warm milk, if needed.\r\n\r\nFor the lasagna: Increase the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the ricotta, egg, 1\/2 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon thyme, and romano cheese in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.\r\n\r\nHeat the olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften. Add the shallots and cook until golden brown and completely dry. Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid, coarsely chop, and add to the mushrooms in the pan and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze with the porcini soaking liquid and cook until completely reduced. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, remaining 1\/4 cup parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nTo assemble: Ladle some of the tomato sauce into the bottom of a 10 by 14 by 2 1\/2-inch baking dish. Ladle some of the cauliflower mornay sauce over the tomato sauce. Top with 4 noodles. Top the noodles with some of the ricotta mixture, then some mushrooms, fontina, and romano. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat to make 4 layers. Ladle the cauliflower mornay sauce over the top of the noodles, making sure to cover the noodles completely with the sauce, and sprinkle with more of the romano cheese. Put the lasagna pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the top with parsley, and let rest 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve additional tomato sauce on the side.\r\n\r\nRecipe courtesy of Bobby Flay\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/bobby-flay\/wild-mushroom-and-cauliflower-lasagna-recipe.html?oc=linkback",

Coat a baking sheet generously with olive oil, arrange eggplant on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast, without disturbing, for 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully flip each piece: the undersides should be blistery, dark and a bit puffy and should release easily; if they don\u2019t want to, cook them a few minutes longer. Flip each piece, sprinkle again with salt and pepper, and roast on the second side for 10 to 12 minutes, or until charred underneath again.\r\n\r\nMake dressing: In food processor, coarsely grind walnuts, cheese, garlic, thyme, salt and freshly ground black pepper and\/or red pepper flakes. Stir in oil and tomatoes, then whisk in vinegar to taste.\r\n\r\nAssemble salad: Toss cooked pasta with walnut dressing and additional vinegar and oil to loosen (I used about 1 tablespoon extra oil and 2 tablespoons extra vinegar in total). Add eggplant and toss again. Adjust seasonings to taste, then stir in cheese and herbs.",

Stir together all the ingredients except the semolina or cornmeal. Beat for 1 minute at high speed of an electric mixer; the dough will become somewhat smooth.\r\n2. Scrape the dough into the center of the bowl, cover, and allow it to rise for about 60 minutes, until it's quite puffy.\r\n3. Grease a large (18\" x 13\") baking sheet; or line with parchment. Grease twelve 3 \u00be\" English muffin rings, and place them on the baking sheet.\r\n4. Sprinkle semolina or cornmeal into each ring.\r\n5. Turn the dough onto a lightly greased or floured work surface. Cut it into 12 equal pieces; each will weigh a scant 2 ounces, or about 54g.\r\n6. Shape the dough into balls. Place each ball into a ring, pressing it down to flatten somewhat. Sprinkle with a bit more cornmeal or semolina, and top with a greased baking sheet (or a sheet of parchment, then the baking sheet). The baking sheet should be resting atop the rings.\r\n7. Let the muffins rise for about 60 to 90 minutes, until they've puffed up noticeably. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\r\n8. Bake the risen muffins for 10 minutes. Flip the pans over, and bake for 5 minutes more. Remove the top pan, and bake for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until they're a light golden brown, and the interior of one registers about 200\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer.\r\n9. Remove the muffins from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool. Remove their rings as soon as you're able. When completely cool, store muffins in a plastic bag.\r\n\r\nYield: 12 muffins.",

        "instructions": "1. To prepare the wheat berries, bring the water and berries to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the berries are tender but still slightly chewy, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and steam for 10 to 15 minutes if you have time. Drain any remaining liquid and transfer to a large serving bowl to cool.\r\n\r\n2. While the wheat berries cool, prepare the salad. Bring the leeks, broth, and orange zest to a boil in a large saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the leeks are soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the leeks, and add them to the serving bowl with the wheat berries. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, 1\/4 cup of the mint, and the capers, fennel seed, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning, keeping in mind that capers and haloumi are quite salty.\r\n\r\n3. To finish, position a rack about 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the broiler. Cut the haloumi cheese into thin slices, about 1\/4 inch thick, and put them on a plate. Sprinkle with the oregano, pepper, pepper flakes, and reserved tomato oil; rub the oil and spices all over to coat the slices on both sides (work gently, as haloumi breaks easily). Transfer the cheese to a medium cast-iron skillet or a broiler pan.\r\n\r\n4. Broil the haloumi until the slices just start to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes, turning once with a spatula. (Watch closely as you don't want the cheese to dry out.)\r\n\r\n5. Top the salad with the haloumi. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons mint, and serve right away.\r\n\r\nTo get a head start: Make the wheat berries, as in step 1, ahead. The salad (without the haloumi) can be prepared 4 to 6 hours ahead. Chill, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.",

Turn the heat up to the highest setting and add the peppers to the pan. Stir-fry with a spatula or long chopsticks. Sprinkle in some salt--this draws out moisture from the vegetables and cooks them a bit faster. Continue stir-frying for 4-5 minutes, until the peppers are cooked.\r\n\r\n2. Push the vegetables to the sides of the pan, and add the seitan to the exposed bottom. Leave for a couple of minutes, then turn over to cook the other side. Stir everything together, and add black pepper and soy sauce.\r\n\r\nFor instant cabbage and cucumber pickles:\r\n\r\n1. cut out the tough vein of the cabbage leaf, and slice the rest into strips. Sprinkle the cabbage and cucumber with the salt and massage well with your hands until the vegetables go limp. Let rest for at least 5 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon juice.\r\n\r\n2. Squeeze out any excess moisture before packing into a bento box. I like to put the pickles in a bento divider cup or cupcake liner to prevent the flavors from mingling with other flavors in the box.\r\n\r\nFor Blanched Broccoli:\r\n\r\n1. Put just enough water in a small pan to cover the broccoli. Bring the water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, and put in the broccoli florets. Boil for 2-3 minutes, drain the water, and run cold tap water over the broccoli to cool quickly and fix the bright green color. Drain well.

Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. Roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. Don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. It will still taste great! Leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Salami and Cream Cheese Rolls:\r\n\r\n1. Peel the carrot and cut into strips to same thickness and length as the green beans.\r\n\r\n2. Bring a pot or pan of water to a rapid boil. Add carrots and green beans, boil for 3-4 minutes until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.\r\n\r\n3. On each piece of salami, place a dollop of cream cheese, a green bean, and a stick or two of carrot. Roll into a little burrito. (If necessary, cut a toothpick in half and use it to pin the salami closed.)\r\n\r\n4. If you have leftover carrots or green beans, dice them for sprinkling over the rice.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Rice:\r\n\r\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with the excess vegetables.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30s-1m, until fragrant and infusing the oil.\r\n\r\n2. Add the spinach and stir-fry rapidly. It will shrink down in mass in no time. When done, turn off heat, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper, and let cool.\r\n\r\n3. Pack into a bento cup for serving.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo instead prepare as a rice bowl (when you're eating it fresh rather than prepping a bento for later), just put the rice serving in a bowl. Fry the eggs, to a soft\/gooey yolk, and put on top of rice. Dice the veggies after boiling, add to the spinach during cooking, and put the whole mixture on top of the eggs. Finally, large dice the salami and small-cube the cream cheese, and put on top of the bowl.\r\n\r\nIf you want a little more kick, add togarashi to the eggs, and\/or drizzle some sriracha or other chili sauce on top of the bowl when done.

        "instructions": "1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ready an ungreased large tube pan (9-inch diameter, 16-cup capacity), preferably with a removable bottom. If the pan bottom is not removable, line it with parchment or wax paper.\r\n\r\n2. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with 3\/4 cup sugar. Place remaining 3\/4 cup sugar in another small bowl next to the mixer.\r\n\r\n3. In the bowl of a standing mixer, or with a handheld mixer, beat egg whites at low speed until just broken up and beginning to froth. Add cream of tartar and salt and beat at medium speed until whites form very soft, billowy mounds. With the mixer still at medium speed, beat in 3\/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all sugar is added and whites are shiny and form soft peaks. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and almond extract and beat until just blended.\r\n\r\n4. Place flour-sugar mixture in a sifter set over waxed paper. Sift flour-sugar mixture over egg whites about 3 tablespoons at a time, and gently fold it in, using a large rubber spatula. Sift any flour-sugar mixture that falls onto the paper back into the bowl with the whites.\r\n\r\n5. Gently scrape batter into pan, smooth the top, and give pan a couple of raps on the counter to release any large air bubbles.\r\n\r\n6. Bake until the cake is golden brown and the top springs back when pressed firmly, 50 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n7. If cake pan has prongs around the rim for elevating the cake, invert pan onto them. If not, invert pan over the neck of a bottle or funnel so that air can circulate all around it. Let the cake cool completely, 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n8. To unmold, run a knife around edges, being careful not to separate the golden crust from the cake. Slide cake out of pan and cut the same way around removable bottom to release, or peel off parchment or wax paper, if used.\r\n\r\n9. Place the cake, bottom-side up, on a platter. Cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife. Serve the cake the day it is made.\r\n\r\nRead more: http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/recipes\/the-best-angel-food-cake-cooks-illustrated\/#ixzz4PHieOlr4",

        "instructions": "Pack **rice** into bento box and allow to cool while prepping remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nMake tiny cuts along the inside of each **shrimp** (opposite site to where the vein was) and gently pull the shrimp straight. This is an optional step, but it does make the shrimp look much bigger.\r\n\r\nPat the shrimps dry, and season with a little salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nPut the **potato starch** in one plate, the **beaten egg** in a small bowl, and the **panko bread crumbs** on another plate. Have another plate ready, lined with a couple of paper towels.\r\n\r\nHeat 1\/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small frying pan over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a panko bread crumb dropped into it turns light brown right away.\r\n\r\nWorking rapidly, coat the shrimps in the cornstarch, dip in the egg,then roll in the bread crumbs. Try to do this with one hand, leaving the other hand clean to hold a pair of chopsticks or tongs to turn the shrimps. Gently put the shrimps one by one into the hot oil. Turn after a minute, and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute on the other side. The shrimps should feel firm when lightly tapped with the chopsticks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as each shrimp is cooked, remove from the oil and drain on the paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Leave the shrimps to cool thoroughly before packing into a bento box.\r\n\r\n\r\nAhead of time note: Bread the shrimps and freeze in a single layer, ideally on a metal baking sheet. Once the shrimps are frozen stiff, pack them in freezer bags or containers. Frozen breaded shrimps should be cooked for 2-3 minutes longer than fresh.\r\n\r\nFor **broccoli**, cook or blanch to desired doneness, then let cool. Combine the rest of the ingredients, then mix with the cooled broccoli.\r\n\r\nTo pack bento:\r\n\r\nPut the **dipping sauce** of your choice in the sauce cup, to tuck into a corner of the bento box. Pack **carrot and celeriac salad** and **dressed broccoli**. Place shrimp on top of rice, if possible.",

        "instructions": "FOR THE DOUGH\r\n\r\n1. Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk at medium speed.\r\n2. As the mixture comes together add 10 ounces of the flour, along with the yeast and salt and continue whisking until combined.\r\n3. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with a dough hook. Add another 4 ounces of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. At this point the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nTO ASSEMBLE\r\n\r\n1. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nFOR THE ICING\r\n\r\n1. Whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nIn case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. To reheat, move to a small plate (I usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. Four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nTo freeze: Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. When ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. Then microwave for 30 seconds.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.\r\n\r\nWhisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly, with some of the butter remaining in larger pieces.\r\n\r\nMix in the cheese, chives, and bacon until evenly distributed.\r\n\r\nAdd \u00be cup of the cream, stirring to combine. Try squeezing the dough together; if it's crumbly and won't hang together, or if there are crumbs remaining in the bottom of the bowl, add cream until the dough comes together. Transfer the shaggy dough to a well-floured work surface.\r\n\r\nPat the dough into a smooth 7\" disk about 3\/4\" thick. Transfer the disk to the prepared baking sheet. Use a knife or bench knife to cut the disk into 8 wedges, spreading the wedges apart a bit on the pan.\r\nBrush the scones with a bit of cream; this will help their crust brown.\r\n\r\nBake the scones for 22 to 24 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\nWant to make scones now, freeze and bake later? Make scones up to the point they're on the baking sheet, cut and ready to bake; don't brush them with cream. Freeze, then remove from the sheet, and wrap airtight in a plastic bag. When you're ready to bake, remove however many you want to bake from the freezer, place on a baking sheet, brush with cream, and bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.\r\n\r\nMake mini-scones: Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a 5\" round. Cut each round into 8 wedges. Bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven till golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes; or for about 25 minutes if frozen.",

        "instructions": "Cook rice: \r\n1. However much cooked rice you need, start with half that of dry rice.\r\n2. Rinse rice to remove starchy coating.\r\n3. Mix with ~1.7x water and a heavy pinch of salt.\r\n4. Boil until done, 20ish minutes.\r\n\r\nFor the tofu:\r\n1. Set the oven to 400\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with baking paper. \r\n2. Toast panko breadcrumbs in a small pan until golden (they will gain more colour in the oven). \r\n3. Cut tofu into thin blocks; ideally equal to # of servings, but if the tofu blocks are narrow, twice that. Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or you can season the flour with plenty of salt instead. \r\n4. Drag tofu in flour making sure that the entire surface area has been coated. Dip the tofu in the egg and finally drag it in the pre-toasted breadcrumbs. \r\n5. Brush a bit of oil on the baking paper underneath the tofu and bake for about 10 minutes per side, flipping halfway thru.\r\n\r\nTo assemble:\r\n\r\n1. Cut a square of cling film slightly larger than your nori sheet. Place it on the table, place the nori sheet on top with the shiny side down and rotated 45\u00b0 in relation to the cling film.\r\n2. Wet your hands (keep a small bowl of water handy to wet your hands) and grab a handful of rice. Place it in the middle of the sheet and using your hands form it into a compacted square (about 9 cm \/ 3.5 \u201d by 9 cm \/ 3.5 \u201c). Try to make that layer as even and compacted as possible. Season well with salt. (Ideally, use an onigirazu mold.)\r\n3. Top with tofu, mayo, then veggies, and finally a second layer of rice.\r\n4. Fold the nori corners over the stack, using the cling film to help keep it together without tearing, until you get a small packet.\r\n5. Finally gather all the cling film over the stack and tie on the top. Put something moderately heavy (like a breadboard) on the onigirazu and set it aside to let the seaweed soften a little. Cut in half with a sharp knife.",

Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1\/2 cups flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.\r\n\r\n3. Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.\r\n\r\n5. Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12\" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.\r\n\r\n6. Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.\r\n\r\n7. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. \r\n\r\n8. Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.\r\nBake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.\r\n\r\n9. Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.\r\n\r\nYield: 4 12\" pizzas, 6 to 8 servings each.\r\nTo freeze: After dividing dough in step 5, wrap ball of dough in plastic wrap and freeze. Allow to defrost in refrigerator and then set out at room temperature for about 30 minutes before shaping crust.",

        "instructions": "1. Prepare the ingredients:\r\nRemove the **dough** from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the **squash** ends; using a knife, peel, then separate the neck and bulb. Halve the bulb; scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds, then medium dice the squash. Toss **apple** matchsticks with the juice of 1 **lemon wedge**.\r\n\r\n2. Make the filling: \r\nIn a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the **squash**; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned and tender. Add the **kale**, **spice blend** and **half the garlic**; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted. Add \u2153 of the **tomatoes**. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until well combined. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n3. Assemble the calzones:\r\nSprinkle **half the flour** onto a work surface. Divide the **dough** into 4 equal-sized portions; using your hands, gently stretch into \u00bc-inch-thick rounds. (If the dough is resistant, let rest for 5 minutes.) Divide the filling (you may have extra) between the rounds; top with the **Fontina cheese** and **half the Parmesan cheese**. Season with salt and pepper. Fold each round in half over the filling. Using your fingers or a fork, press or crimp the edges of the dough to seal.\r\n\r\n4. Bake the calzones:\r\nSprinkle the **remaining flour** onto a large sheet pan. Carefully transfer the calzones to the prepared sheet pan; lightly drizzle or brush the tops with olive oil. Bake 16 to 18 minutes, or until browned on top. Remove from the oven and let stand for 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.\r\n\r\n5. Make the tomato sauce:\r\nWhile the calzones bake, wipe out the pan used to make the filling. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and heat on medium until hot. Add the **remaining garlic** and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the **remaining tomatoes** and \u00bc cup of **water**. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened and saucy; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish.\r\n\r\n6. Make the salad & serve your dish:\r\nWhile the calzones continue to bake, to make the dressing, in a bowl, combine the **remaining Parmesan cheese** and the juice of the **remaining lemon wedges**. Slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons of olive oil until well combined; season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, in a bowl, combine the **arugula** and **apple**. Add enough of the dressing to coat (you may have extra). Toss to mix; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish. Serve with the baked calzones and tomato sauce. Enjoy!",

Cover beans with water, so the water level is a couple of inches above the beans, and bring to a boil, then turn heat down so it\u2019s simmering gently. Put a lid on the pot, and cook until beans are tender, adding more water as needed to keep the beans submerged. This could take 1 to 2 hours or more, depending on the beans and whether or not you soaked them.\r\n\r\nUse a spoon to fish out the onion and garlic; discard. In a small bowl, whisk together the miso and and a little bean broth until smooth. Add back to beans. Taste a couple of beans along with the broth. It should be opaque and slightly creamy; adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed.\r\n\r\nBrush both sides of each piece of bread with olive oil, and place on a foil-lined sheet pan. Run the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, so the bread is crisp at the edges and nicely toasted, then flip bread and repeat. While the bread is still hot, rub a garlic clove along one side of each piece, as if you were grating the garlic on the bread, pushing just firmly enough for the clove to fray and dissolve slightly into the bread.\r\n\r\nTo assemble, place a piece of bread at the bottom of four wide, shallow bowls and ladle hot beans and broth on top. Wait a few seconds for the bread to absorb some broth, then ladle a little extra on each one, so it\u2019s swimming.

Prepare 2 ice baths in 2 medium bowls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, prepare the dressing: In a small bowl, stir together the scallion, mayonnaise, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, vinegar and mustard. Season to taste with kosher\r\n\r\nOnce the water reaches a boil, gently drop in all eggs and let the water come back to a boil. As soon as it does so, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the eggs at a gentle simmer, 8 minutes. Transfer half of the soft-boiled eggs to one ice bath. Continue to cook the remaining eggs until hard-boiled, another 6 minutes, then transfer them to the second ice bath. Let sit, 5 minutes. Crack all cooked egg shells by gently hitting them all over with the back of a spoon.\r\n\r\nWorking directly in the bowl, peel the hard-boiled eggs, keeping them partly immersed (the water helps loosen the shells). Transfer the hard-boiled eggs to a cutting board and chop them into 1\/4-inch pieces. Gently fold the chopped eggs into the egg salad dressing using a rubber spatula. Season to taste with kosher salt.\r\n\r\nWorking directly in the second bowl, carefully peel the soft-boiled eggs. Transfer the peeled eggs to the cutting board and slice them in half lengthwise. The yolks should be creamy but not runny. If the yolks are runny, make another batch of soft-boiled eggs. (You\u2019ll only need 1 soft-boiled egg per sandwich, so snack on any extra or imperfectly peeled pieces with some flaky sea salt, if desired.)\r\n\r\nSlather mustard on 1 side of 4 bread slices and mayonnaise on 1 side of the remaining 4 bread slices. \r\n\r\nSprinkle flaky sea salt on the halved soft-boiled eggs. Arrange 2 halves down the center of each slice of mustard-slathered bread, laying them yolk side down, and positioning them so the narrower tips point outward toward the crust of the bread and the wider, rounder portions (with the yolks) are in the middle of the bread. Place both halves close enough so that they touch in the center of the bread.\r\n\r\nDivide the egg salad among the sandwiches, gently plopping 1\/2-cup scoops of egg salad on top of each pair of soft-boiled eggs on each of the 4 bread slices. Using an offset spatula, spread the egg salad evenly toward the crusts in all directions until bread is covered.\r\n\r\nTop with the remaining slices of bread, mayonnaise side down. Using a serrated knife, carefully slice the crusts off on the left and the right sides of each sandwich. (These should be the 2 sides that are parallel to the soft-boiled eggs.)\r\n\r\nRotate each sandwich 90 degrees and cut each sandwich into thirds, cutting parallel to the crust sides of the sandwiches, creating a beautiful exposed cross section.

Stir gently. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes until noodles are cooked through, a bit past the al dente stage.\r\n\r\nDrain the noodles and rinse under cold water to cool quickly. Rinse until noodles are smooth and firm and not at all sticky. Allow noodle to drain in colander while the rest is being prepped.\r\n\r\nFor dipping sauce: combine dashi and kaeshi. Pack in a leak-proof container.\r\n\r\nFor crab salad: Massage the cabbage with the salt until the cabbage has wilted. Squeeze well to expel excess moisture. Put in a bowl, add the vinegar and sugar, and mix. Add the crab and taste; add a little more salt if needed. Sprinkle with sansho or black pepper.\r\n\r\nTo pack: Put the noodles in one compartment, sprinkle with green onion, keep nori and sesame seeds separate. Pack crab and cabbage salad in a divider cup. Halve egg and pack near noodles. Fill in any gaps with cherry tomatoes.",

Cook, stirring frequently, 1-2 minutes or until softened. Turn off the heat.\r\n\r\n3. Lightly oil a sheet pan or sprinkle generously with semolina. Using your hands, gently stretch the **dough** to 1\/4-inch thickness. Carefully transfer to the sheet pan. Leaving a 1-inch border around the edges, spread enough of the **tomato sauce** onto the prepared dough to coat (you may have extra). Evenly top with the **cooked broccoli**, **sliced shallot**, **mozzarella cheese**, and **chopped peppers**. Season with salt and pepper. Bake, rotating the sheet pan half way through, 17-19 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and let stand at least 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. While the pizza bakes, in a bowl, combine the **ricotta cheese**, a drizzle of olive oil, and as much of the chile paste as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be.
