Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",

Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.\r\n\r\nPat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nRoll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.\r\n\r\nBrush biscuit tops with melted butter.  Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes.  Let cool on baking sheet 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",

From left to right, you want to have your slat and pepper in one, flour in the second, beaten egg in the third and your fine breadcrumbs in the fourth. It's very simple...season the pieces of meat and dip them into the flour, shaking off any excess, then put them into the egg, dripping off any excess, and into the breadcrumbs, patting them over both sides and pressing down quite firmly. Gently shake off any excess and put the meat on a board or clean plate ready to be cooked.\r\n\r\nHeat a heavy frying pan, add a couple of good glugs of olive oil and, when it's good and hot, put both pieces of pork into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes or so, then carefully start to shake and agitate the pan to cover them in the hot oil. Turn the pork over and continue to cook for a couple of minutes until both sides are crisp and golden brown. Remove to a tray line with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Put a schnitzel on to each of your serving plates. Put a little pile of cornichon matchsticks and some watercress leaves on top and serve with a big lob of apple sauce, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.",

Sift flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and 1 1\/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of a mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined. Raise speed to medium and add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Divide batter among pans. Bake until cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks and let cool completely.\r\n\r\n3. Make the caramel: Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring, until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat, and carefully pour in cream (mixture will bubble violently); stir until smooth. Return to heat, and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238F, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Let cool completely.\r\n\r\n4. Meanwhile, make the frosting: whisk together cocoa and warm water in a bowl until cocoa dissolves. Beat butter, confections' sugar, and a generous pinch of coarse salt in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in melted chocolate and then cocoa mixture until combined. Let stand for 30 minutes before using.\r\n\r\n5. Trim tops of cakes using a serrated knife to creat a level surface. Cut each in half horizontally to form 2 layers. Transfer 1 layer to a serving platter and spread 3\/4 cup caramel over top. Top with another cake layer, and repeat with remaining caramel and cake layers, leaving top uncovered. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\n6. Frost top and sides of cake in a swirling motion. Sprinkle with sea salt.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: Caramel can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using. Cake layers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days (they actually taste better when refrigerated and have a better texture for stacking).\r\n\r\nStorage: Frosted cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, using your fingers, combine the orange zest with the sugar \u2013 rubbing the grains as if you were playing with sand to release the orange oils into the sugar.\r\nUsing an electric mixer, beat the oil with the orange sugar until well mixed. In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt.\r\n\r\nAdd the orange juice and brandy to mixer and mix well.\r\n\r\nSlowly incorporate the flour cup by cup until the mixture forms a dough that is not too loose but not quite firm either. It will be dense and wet but not sticky. Once the flour is incorporated fully stop mixing.\r\n\r\nTo roll cookies, pinch a portion of dough off about the size of a walnut. Shape in your palms into a smooth oblong shape, almost like a small egg. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Shape and roll cookies until the sheet is filled.\r\n\r\nPress the tines of a large fork in a crosshatch pattern in the center of each cookie. This will flatten them slightly in the center. The cookies should resemble lightly flattened ovals when they go in the oven.\r\n\r\nBake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 25 \u2013 30 minutes until lightly browned. (The cookies will darken when submerged in syrup.)\r\n\r\nWhile the cookies are baking, prepare the syrup.\r\n\r\nIn a saucepan, combine the honey, sugar, water, cinnamon, cloves, and lemon rind. Bring the mixture to a boil then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon, cloves, and lemon rind and stir in lemon juice.\r\n\r\nPlace the ground walnuts in a shallow plate or bowl next to the stove top. When the cookies come out of the oven and while they are still very warm, carefully float the cookies in the syrup and allow the cookies to absorb syrup on both sides.\r\n\r\nUsing a fork or small spatula, remove the cookie from the syrup and place on a platter or plate. Press ground walnuts lightly into the tops of the cookies (syrup will help it adhere) and sprinkle lightly with ground cinnamon.\r\n\r\nDo not refrigerate Melomakarona as they will harden.

Depending on how they are folded (see below), they can be baked or fried. They are holiday tradition on the Greek island of Crete, but eaten at other times as well because they're so delicious! These call for the fresh soft variety of myzithra (not the aged salty type) cheese, and if you can't find it, try Italian mascarpone or ricotta.",

Lightly grease a baking sheet.\r\n\r\nMake the pastry\r\n\r\nOn a floured surface with a rolling pin, roll a piece of dough out to a thickness of about 1\/8th of an inch. Using a 3-4 inch cutter or saucer as a guide, cut out circles. (Alternatively, take a piece of dough the size of an unshelled walnut and roll it out to a circle about 3-4 inches across.)\r\n\r\nPlace a spoonful of the cheese mixture into the center of the circle and spread out close to the edges. Raise the rim of the dough up around the cheese and, with wet fingers, pinch the edges to pull the dough in around the cheese, leaving the center open so the cheese shows.\r\n\r\nRepeat using all the dough and filling. Place the kalitsounia on the baking sheet and brush lightly with beaten egg to glaze. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for approximately 20 minutes until lightly browned (see photo). Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.\r\n\r\nAllow to cool on the baking sheet. Kalitsounia will keep well, covered, in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nTo fry\r\n\r\nPlace a teaspoonful of cheese mix into the center of the circle, fold the circle over into a half-moon shape. With wet fingers, crimp the edges to close securely. Preheat 1 cup of olive oil over medium heat and fry until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels.

Dough may be scooped into balls, wrapped well, and frozen for up to several months. For hot homemade cookies, FAST, simply place frozen dough balls on a baking sheet, and bake for a minute or so longer than the directions indicate. These cookies stay nice and fresh for a day or so after baking. Freeze for longer storage. To make sure your oven temperature is exactly right, bake a sample cookie first. If the cookie spreads too much, raise the oven temperature slightly. If it doesn't spread enough, lower the oven temperature slightly, or pat the dough down slightly before baking.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. Then we\u2019ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. When it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3\/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. Wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. Store in an airtight jar for several months.",

In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the whites into the cupcake batter. Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 batches.\r\n4. Divide batter among baking cups, filling each halfway full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean and the tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely in tins set on wire racks.\r\n5. Meanwhile, make the caramel: bring granulated sugar and water to a boil in a small high-sided saucepan, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-high, and cook until mixture just starts to turn pale gold around edges. Remove from heat, and immediately pour caramel onto a rimmed baking sheet. Working quickly, tilt pan to spread caramel to edges to make a very thin layer. Let cool to harden.\r\n6. Make the frosting: beat cream cheese and butter with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable.\r\n7. Frost each cupcake using an offset spatula. Twist pan to release and break caramel in order for it to resemble broken glass. Place a shard or 2 of caramel \"glass\" in the center of each cupcake. Drizzle or pipe cherry preserves where caramel has entered the cupcake.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: unfrosted cupcakes can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. Frosting can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. Caramel can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day, break just before using.\r\n\r\nStorage: frosted cupcakes can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.

        "instructions": "Sauce: Put the tomatoes, garlic and onion in a blender. Blend until smooth. In a medium saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\r\n\r\nChile rellenos: Mix the cheese and oregano in a small bowl. Cut a slit through 1 side of the charred chiles and fill each chile with 1\/4 cup of the cheese mixture. Close with toothpicks to hold the filling in place. In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat for about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you don't have a thermometer a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Dredge the filled chiles in flour until fully covered. Shake off any excess flour, then dip the chiles into the egg mixture, until well coated. Fry until golden brown and drain on paper towels.\r\n\r\nArrange the chiles on a serving platter, spoon the sauce on top and serve.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nTo char the chiles (or any fresh chile): Put the chiles over a gas flame or underneath the broiler and cook until they are blackened on all sides. Enclose them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam, which will make them easier to peel. Peel, stem, and seed the chiles. Once peeled, the chiles may be chopped, sliced or stuffed.",

Gradually beat in the remaining 1 1\/4 cups flour, scraping the bowl as needed, to form a wet dough, about4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high; add the whole egg, sugar, salt and vanilla and beat until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time; beat until incorporated. The dough will be very wet.\r\n\r\nBrush a large bowl with butter; transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Stir the dough to punch it down; cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or up to overnight.\r\n\r\nGenerously dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Pat the dough into a square on the parchment, then roll into an 11-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the dough and parchment to a baking sheet and brush off the excess flour. Cover and chill until firm enough to shape, 1 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, make the filling: Pulse the almonds and sugar in a food processor until fine. Add the butter, egg, rum, vanilla, cinnamon, orange zest and almond extract; pulse until smooth. Cover and chill 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMake the streusel: Mash the confectioners' sugar, flour and butter in a bowl with a fork to make clumps. Cover and chill until ready to use.\r\n\r\nButter an 8 1\/2-by-4 1\/2-inch loaf pan. Spread the almond filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border; sprinkle with the chocolate. Starting from a short side, use the parchment to tightly roll up the dough, brushing off the excess flour. Pinch the ends of the roll, then twist several times. Fold the twist in half so the ends meet. Twist the folded dough again and place in the pan. Cover with buttered parchment; let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 2 hours.\r\n\r\n***If desired, make up to this point 1 day in advance. Cover with buttered parchment, then wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Remove 1 hour before baking.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the loaf with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with the streusel. Bake until the bread is golden and springs back when pressed, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes.

        "instructions": "1) To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, until you have a soft, smooth dough.\r\n\r\n2) Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 2 hours, or until it's puffy and nearly doubled in bulk.\r\n\r\n3) Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.\r\n\r\n4) Pat and roll the dough into a rectangle about 18\" x 14\".\r\n\r\n5) Make the cinnamon filling: Mix the cinnamon sugar with some melted butter and water to make a paste OR mix the Baker's Cinnamon Filling and water to make a smooth paste.\r\n\r\n6) Looking at the dough horizontally (so it's 18\" long), spread half the filling down the center third of the dough\r\n\r\n7) Slice each banana into about 12 rounds. Space the slices atop the filling.\r\n\r\n8) Fold one of the end pieces into the center to cover the bananas and filling.\r\n\r\n9) Spread the remaining filling atop the piece of dough you've just folded into the center, and distribute the dried pineapple evenly atop the filling.\r\n\r\n10) Fold the other side of the dough over the filling to cover it. Pull the long side seam underneath, and tuck each end underneath, too. You should have a long, flat log with no filling showing.\r\n\r\n11) Use a sharp knife to cut 4 diagonal slashes atop the loaf, cutting through both layers of dough; this will allow steam to escape.\r\n\r\n12) Brush with the beaten egg white, and sprinkle with the coarse or Demerara sugar.\r\n\r\n13) Cover the loaf gently with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 1 hour. It won't rise much, if at all. Towards the end of the resting period, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\r\n\r\n14) Bake the loaf in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes. Tent with foil, and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, till it's golden brown and a sharp knife poked into the center doesn't reveal any raw dough.\r\n\r\n15) Remove from the oven, and transfer to a rack to cool.\r\n\r\nYield: 1 large loaf, about 16 servings.",

It helps to use a tablespoon cookie scoop or small ice cream scoop here. For best results, pack the coconut mixture into the scoop; each ball should weigh about 1 ounce. You can space the balls fairly close together on the baking sheet; they only need about 3\/4\" to 1\" between them.\r\n\r\n5) Bake the macaroons for about 10 minutes; they won't brown. You may see the merest hint of brown on top.\r\n\r\n6) Remove from the oven, and cool completely on the baking sheet.\r\n\r\n7) To make the coating, heat the chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup until the chips are very soft. A microwave oven works well, as does a saucepan set over very low heat.\r\n\r\n8) Dip half of each cooled macaroon into the chocolate. Set the macaroons back on the baking sheet, and allow the chocolate to set completely before serving. To store, place in one layer in a closed container. They'll keep for 2 or 3 days, but will gradually become less moist as they sit.\r\n\r\nYield: 33 macaroons.\r\n\r\ntips from our bakers\r\nCoconut cream, sweetened condensed coconut milk, is the coconut equivalent of sweetened condensed milk. Substitute sweetened condensed milk, if desired.\r\nCoconut milk powder adds flavor and helps the macaroons hold their nice, smooth shape. Leave it out if you like.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 or 400 degrees F.\r\n\r\nBake the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check them!\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are still hot peel and pass them through a food mill or ricer. (I find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nWhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\nCrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nForm the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 1\/2-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!!\r\n\r\nUse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\nP.S. These are Chef Anne \"Secrets\" to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time.\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/anne-burrell\/gnocchi-with-prosciutto-spring-peas-and-chanterelles-recipe\/index.html?oc=linkback",

Add salt and vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract) and mix for a few seconds to combine.\r\n3. Add flour and mix for 1-2 minutes, until large crumbs form. Pour mixture out on to a work surface and knead several times until a smooth ball forms.\r\n4. Scoop up small balls of dough, about 2 tablespoons each. Roll each ball between the palms of your hands till you form smooth, round circles. Place dough balls on prepared cookie sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.\r\n5. Flatten each ball with a flat-bottomed glass to a disk about \u00bd inch thick.\r\n6. Make an indention, about \u00bd inch in diameter in the center of each dough disk. Use any round-ended utensil to make the indentions, such as the end of a wooden spoon or ice cream scoop.\r\n7. Place sheet pans with prepared cookies in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before baking. This will keep them from spreading out too much.\r\n8. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until beginning to turn golden at bottom edges.\r\n9. Remove to a wire cooling rack.\r\n10. Fill the center of each cookie with a generous rounded teaspoon of the caramel mixture.\r\n11. Sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt. Allow to cool and \u201cset\u201d for at least an hour before serving.\r\n\r\nDirections for the caramel:\r\n1. Combine the butter, brown sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup and heavy cream. Bring to a boil stirring till dissolved.\r\n2. Reduce heat to a steady simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until mixture reaches 220?F* on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add vanilla.

When the pan is hot enough for a bead of water to instantly sizzle and evaporate, add just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and swirl to coat pan.\r\n\r\n2 Add the shrimp, quickly spreading out around the cooking surface area so that they are not overlapping. Let fry, untouched for 30 seconds. Flip over and let the other side fry for 30 seconds, or until about 80% cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the pan onto a plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\r\n\r\n3 Turn the heat to medium, let the pan heat up again. Add the eggs, stirring in a quick motion to break up and scramble the eggs. When the eggs are almost cooked through (they should still be slightly runny in the middle), dish out of the pan into the same plate as the cooked shrimp.\r\n\r\n4 Use paper towels to wipe the same wok or saut\u00e9 pan clean and return to high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling to coat. When the oil is very hot, add the green onions and fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in the rice and stir well to mix in the green onions throughout. Spread the rice all around the wok surface area and let the rice heat up, untouched until you hear the bottoms of the grains sizzle, about 1-2 minutes. Use the spatula to toss the rice, again spreading the rice out over the surface of wok.\r\n\r\n5 Drizzle the soy sauce all around the rice and toss. Add the peas and carrots, the cooked eggs, shrimp and sesame oil, tossing to mix the rice evenly with all of the ingredients. Let everything heat back up again, until the rice grains are so hot they practically dance! Taste and add an additional 1 teaspoon of soy sauce if needed.",

Cover the pan until the couscous is tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 to 6 minutes. Put the couscous in a large bowl and add the beans, currants, spinach, feta and 1\/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir until all the ingredients are combined.\r\n\r\nSlice the tops off the peppers and remove all the ribs and seeds. If necessary, cut a very thin slice from the base to help the peppers stand up. Stuff the peppers with the filling and drizzle the tops with olive oil. Put the peppers in an 8 by 8-inch square baking dish. Fill the baking dish with 3\/4-inch hot water and bake until the filling is golden and the peppers are cooked through, about 55 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nSauce: In a blender, combine the basil, creme fraiche, olive oil, water, garlic, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.\r\n\r\nRemove the peppers from the oven and arrange on serving plates. Spoon the sauce around the peppers and serve.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using slow-cooker, skip the chicken broth and add the dry couscous and cumin directly to the bowl with the rest of the filling.  Cook in the slow cooker for 4 hours on High.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf using poblanos, instead preheat the oven to 475. Halve and clean the poblanos, cover in oil, salt, and pepper, and roast the halves for 11-13 minutes, until slightly softened. Remove from oven, but leave oven on.\r\n\r\nWhen filling is ready, pack into the poblano halves. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, until the peppers are softened.

Combine the cream cheese, sugar and flour in a small bowl, and mix until smooth. Add the egg yolk and flavoring (if using), mixing until smooth once again. Transfer the mixture to a disposable pastry bag, and cut just the very tip off the end, as shown.\r\n\r\n2. Place a small pool of the mixture in the center of the brownie batter. Draw circles around this pool, about 1 inch apart, moving out from the center each time.\r\n\r\n3. Once the circles are drawn, take a table knife, wet the tip, and draw it back and forth through the circles.\r\n\r\n4. The knife will draw the cream cheese filling into arcs, as you see here. Once you've gone all the way around the circles, take up your pastry bag again.\r\n\r\n5. Use the remaining filling to trace the path where the knife travelled, to create the spokes of the web.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, until the brownies just barely pull away from the edge of the pan. The center will rise while baking, but will sink back level once the brownies are cool.

Or simply combine the butter and sugar, and heat, stirring, until the butter is melted. Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110\u00b0F to 120\u00b0F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.\r\n\r\n4) Add the hot butter\/sugar mixture to the egg\/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.\r\n\r\n5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth. Note: If you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies, rather than melting in, let the batter cool in the bowl for about 20 minutes before stirring in the chips.\r\n\r\n6) Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" pan.\r\n\r\n7) Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, or with just a few moist crumbs clinging to it.

Cool the eggplant 20 minutes. Leave the oven on.\r\n\r\n2. Slice the eggplant in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh (discard the skin). Place the roasted eggplant in a medium bowl and stir in the egg and beans. Add the garlic, basil, parmesan, salt and pepper and stir to combine, then mix in the breadcrumbs.\r\n\r\n3. Again, line the rimmed baking sheet with a clean sheet of foil and lightly mist it with spray. Shape the eggplant mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball (2 tablespoons per ball; you should get about 16). Place them on the prepared baking sheet and lightly mist the top of the balls with spray. Bake the eggplant balls until they are golden brown and firm, about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. While the meatballs cook, warm the marinara sauce in a small saucepan. Remove the meatballs from the oven, sprinkle with a little extra parmesan and serve with the marinara sauce.",

        "instructions": "1. In a double boiler, or in the microwave, gently melt together the chocolate and butter. To avoid heating the chocolate too much and possibly burning it, the best method is to heat until the butter is melted and the chocolate has partially melted, then remove from the heat. Stir until all the chocolate melts.\r\n\r\n2. In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until they're thoroughly combined. Add the hot melted chocolate, then stir in the remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\n3. Refrigerate the batter-like dough until it's thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours (or overnight). It needs to set and stiffen up before it can be scooped into balls.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, three if you have them. Or line sheets with parchment, and grease the parchment.\r\n\r\n5. Drop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls (balls about 1\" across) onto the prepared baking sheets. A teaspoon cookie scoop makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2\" between the dough balls, as they'll spread as they bake.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the cookies for 10 to 11 minutes, until their tops are shiny and cracked. They won't crack until the very end, so keep a close eye on them; when they're cracked all the way across the top surface, they're just about done. The point is, you want these baked all the way through, but just barely; additional baking will make them crisp rather than chewy.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the cookies from the oven. After a few minutes, gently loosen them with a spatula, then let them finish cooling on the pan.\r\n\r\nYield: about 4 dozen 2\" cookies.",

Heat broiler.\r\n\r\nWhile eggplant cooks, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch broiler-safe skillet over medium-low heat until just shimmering. Add garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Cover and set aside.\r\n\r\n(If making own bread crumbs, pulse bread in food processor until finely ground, 10 to 15 pulses.) Combine bread crumbs with all other ingredients in medium bowl.\r\n\r\nWith widest ends of eggplant slices facing you, evenly distribute ricotta mixture on bottom third of each slice. Gently roll up each eggplant slice and place seam side down in tomato sauce.\r\n\r\nBring sauce to simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and broil until eggplant is well browned and cheese is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining Pecorino and basil and let stand for 5 minutes, then serve.",

Cut the tofu pieces depending on how you plan to use it.\r\n\r\n3. Marinate the tofu (optional). Place marinade in a shallow dish and add tofu; toss. Place in the fridge for at least 30m and up to overnight.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the tofu: arrange the tofu on the baking sheet in a single layer. Try to avoid the pieces touching each other. Bake until the outside of the tofu is golden and the pieces look slightly puffed, 20 to 45 minutes depending on the size and shape of your tofu. Toss the tofu every 10 minutes so the pieces bake evenly. The longer you bake the tofu, the chewier it will be.\r\n\r\n7. Cool and store: if save the tofu for later, let it cool on the baking sheet, then transfer to a refrigerator container.

Slowly whisk in 4 cups of the milk, increase the heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a blender (in batches) and puree until smooth. Strain the mixture into a clean saucepan through a medium mesh strainer and bring to a simmer over low heat. Whisk in the nutmeg, cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook for 1 minute. Add some of the remaining warm milk, if needed.\r\n\r\nFor the lasagna: Increase the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the ricotta, egg, 1\/2 cup parsley, 1 teaspoon thyme, and romano cheese in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.\r\n\r\nHeat the olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften. Add the shallots and cook until golden brown and completely dry. Drain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid, coarsely chop, and add to the mushrooms in the pan and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze with the porcini soaking liquid and cook until completely reduced. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, remaining 1\/4 cup parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nTo assemble: Ladle some of the tomato sauce into the bottom of a 10 by 14 by 2 1\/2-inch baking dish. Ladle some of the cauliflower mornay sauce over the tomato sauce. Top with 4 noodles. Top the noodles with some of the ricotta mixture, then some mushrooms, fontina, and romano. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat to make 4 layers. Ladle the cauliflower mornay sauce over the top of the noodles, making sure to cover the noodles completely with the sauce, and sprinkle with more of the romano cheese. Put the lasagna pan on a baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until bubbly and the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the top with parsley, and let rest 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve additional tomato sauce on the side.\r\n\r\nRecipe courtesy of Bobby Flay\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/bobby-flay\/wild-mushroom-and-cauliflower-lasagna-recipe.html?oc=linkback",

Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the berries are tender but still slightly chewy, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover, and steam for 10 to 15 minutes if you have time. Drain any remaining liquid and transfer to a large serving bowl to cool.\r\n\r\n2. While the wheat berries cool, prepare the salad. Bring the leeks, broth, and orange zest to a boil in a large saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the leeks are soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the leeks, and add them to the serving bowl with the wheat berries. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, 1\/4 cup of the mint, and the capers, fennel seed, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning, keeping in mind that capers and haloumi are quite salty.\r\n\r\n3. To finish, position a rack about 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the broiler. Cut the haloumi cheese into thin slices, about 1\/4 inch thick, and put them on a plate. Sprinkle with the oregano, pepper, pepper flakes, and reserved tomato oil; rub the oil and spices all over to coat the slices on both sides (work gently, as haloumi breaks easily). Transfer the cheese to a medium cast-iron skillet or a broiler pan.\r\n\r\n4. Broil the haloumi until the slices just start to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes, turning once with a spatula. (Watch closely as you don't want the cheese to dry out.)\r\n\r\n5. Top the salad with the haloumi. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons mint, and serve right away.\r\n\r\nTo get a head start: Make the wheat berries, as in step 1, ahead. The salad (without the haloumi) can be prepared 4 to 6 hours ahead. Chill, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.",

Turn the heat up to the highest setting and add the peppers to the pan. Stir-fry with a spatula or long chopsticks. Sprinkle in some salt--this draws out moisture from the vegetables and cooks them a bit faster. Continue stir-frying for 4-5 minutes, until the peppers are cooked.\r\n\r\n2. Push the vegetables to the sides of the pan, and add the seitan to the exposed bottom. Leave for a couple of minutes, then turn over to cook the other side. Stir everything together, and add black pepper and soy sauce.\r\n\r\nFor instant cabbage and cucumber pickles:\r\n\r\n1. cut out the tough vein of the cabbage leaf, and slice the rest into strips. Sprinkle the cabbage and cucumber with the salt and massage well with your hands until the vegetables go limp. Let rest for at least 5 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon juice.\r\n\r\n2. Squeeze out any excess moisture before packing into a bento box. I like to put the pickles in a bento divider cup or cupcake liner to prevent the flavors from mingling with other flavors in the box.\r\n\r\nFor Blanched Broccoli:\r\n\r\n1. Put just enough water in a small pan to cover the broccoli. Bring the water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, and put in the broccoli florets. Boil for 2-3 minutes, drain the water, and run cold tap water over the broccoli to cool quickly and fix the bright green color. Drain well. Use broccoli and cherry tomatoes to fill in gaps in the bento box.",

        "instructions": "For Basic Tamagoyaki:\r\n\r\n1. Mix together all of the tamagoyaki ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy.\r\n\r\n2. Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. Roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. Don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. It will still taste great! Leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Vegetables:\r\n\r\n1. Place veggies into a heat proof bowl with a large pinch of salt.\r\n\r\n2. Add just enough boiling water to cover. Let stand for 5 minutes or until carrots have softened slightly.\r\n\r\n3. Drain and cool before packing into bento.\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Rice:\r\n\r\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with sesame seeds or furikake.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30s-1m, until fragrant and infusing the oil.\r\n\r\n2. Add the spinach and stir-fry rapidly. It will shrink down in mass in no time. When done, turn off heat, season with salt, pepper, and let cool.\r\n\r\n3. Pack into a bento cup for serving.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo instead prepare as a rice bowl (when you're eating it fresh rather than prepping a bento for later), just put the rice serving in a bowl. Fry the eggs, to a soft\/gooey yolk, and put on top of rice. Dice the veggies after boiling, add to the spinach during cooking, and put the whole mixture on top of the eggs. \r\n\r\nIf you want a little more kick, add togarashi to the eggs, and\/or drizzle some sriracha or other chili sauce on top of the bowl when done.

        "instructions": "1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ready an ungreased large tube pan (9-inch diameter, 16-cup capacity), preferably with a removable bottom. If the pan bottom is not removable, line it with parchment or wax paper.\r\n\r\n2. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with 3\/4 cup sugar. Place remaining 3\/4 cup sugar in another small bowl next to the mixer.\r\n\r\n3. In the bowl of a standing mixer, or with a handheld mixer, beat egg whites at low speed until just broken up and beginning to froth. Add cream of tartar and salt and beat at medium speed until whites form very soft, billowy mounds. With the mixer still at medium speed, beat in 3\/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all sugar is added and whites are shiny and form soft peaks. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and almond extract and beat until just blended.\r\n\r\n4. Place flour-sugar mixture in a sifter set over waxed paper. Sift flour-sugar mixture over egg whites about 3 tablespoons at a time, and gently fold it in, using a large rubber spatula. Sift any flour-sugar mixture that falls onto the paper back into the bowl with the whites.\r\n\r\n5. Gently scrape batter into pan, smooth the top, and give pan a couple of raps on the counter to release any large air bubbles.\r\n\r\n6. Bake until the cake is golden brown and the top springs back when pressed firmly, 50 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n7. If cake pan has prongs around the rim for elevating the cake, invert pan onto them. If not, invert pan over the neck of a bottle or funnel so that air can circulate all around it. Let the cake cool completely, 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n8. To unmold, run a knife around edges, being careful not to separate the golden crust from the cake. Slide cake out of pan and cut the same way around removable bottom to release, or peel off parchment or wax paper, if used.\r\n\r\n9. Place the cake, bottom-side up, on a platter. Cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife. Serve the cake the day it is made.\r\n\r\nRead more: http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/recipes\/the-best-angel-food-cake-cooks-illustrated\/#ixzz4PHieOlr4",

        "instructions": "Pack **rice** into bento box and allow to cool while prepping remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nMake tiny cuts along the inside of each **shrimp** (opposite site to where the vein was) and gently pull the shrimp straight. This is an optional step, but it does make the shrimp look much bigger.\r\n\r\nPat the shrimps dry, and season with a little salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nPut the **potato starch** in one plate, the **beaten egg** in a small bowl, and the **panko bread crumbs** on another plate. Have another plate ready, lined with a couple of paper towels.\r\n\r\nHeat 1\/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small frying pan over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a panko bread crumb dropped into it turns light brown right away.\r\n\r\nWorking rapidly, coat the shrimps in the cornstarch, dip in the egg,then roll in the bread crumbs. Try to do this with one hand, leaving the other hand clean to hold a pair of chopsticks or tongs to turn the shrimps. Gently put the shrimps one by one into the hot oil. Turn after a minute, and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute on the other side. The shrimps should feel firm when lightly tapped with the chopsticks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as each shrimp is cooked, remove from the oil and drain on the paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Leave the shrimps to cool thoroughly before packing into a bento box.\r\n\r\n\r\nAhead of time note: Bread the shrimps and freeze in a single layer, ideally on a metal baking sheet. Once the shrimps are frozen stiff, pack them in freezer bags or containers. Frozen breaded shrimps should be cooked for 2-3 minutes longer than fresh.\r\n\r\nFor **broccoli**, cook or blanch to desired doneness, then let cool. Combine the rest of the ingredients, then mix with the cooled broccoli.\r\n\r\nTo pack bento:\r\n\r\nPut the **dipping sauce** of your choice in the sauce cup, to tuck into a corner of the bento box. Pack **carrot and celeriac salad** and **dressed broccoli**. Place shrimp on top of rice, if possible.",

        "instructions": "FOR THE DOUGH\r\n\r\n1. Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk at medium speed.\r\n2. As the mixture comes together add 10 ounces of the flour, along with the yeast and salt and continue whisking until combined.\r\n3. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with a dough hook. Add another 4 ounces of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. At this point the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nTO ASSEMBLE\r\n\r\n1. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nFOR THE ICING\r\n\r\n1. Whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nIn case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. To reheat, move to a small plate (I usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. Four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nTo freeze: Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. When ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. Then microwave for 30 seconds.",

Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\nWant to make scones now, freeze and bake later? Make scones up to the point they're on the baking sheet, cut and ready to bake; don't brush them with cream. Freeze, then remove from the sheet, and wrap airtight in a plastic bag. When you're ready to bake, remove however many you want to bake from the freezer, place on a baking sheet, brush with cream, and bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.\r\n\r\nMake mini-scones: Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a 5\" round. Cut each round into 8 wedges. Bake in a preheated 425\u00b0F oven till golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes; or for about 25 minutes if frozen.",

        "instructions": "Cook rice: \r\n1. However much cooked rice you need, start with half that of dry rice.\r\n2. Rinse rice to remove starchy coating.\r\n3. Mix with ~1.7x water and a heavy pinch of salt.\r\n4. Boil until done, 20ish minutes.\r\n\r\nFor the tofu:\r\n1. Set the oven to 400\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with baking paper. \r\n2. Toast panko breadcrumbs in a small pan until golden (they will gain more colour in the oven). \r\n3. Cut tofu into thin blocks; ideally equal to # of servings, but if the tofu blocks are narrow, twice that. Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or you can season the flour with plenty of salt instead. \r\n4. Drag tofu in flour making sure that the entire surface area has been coated. Dip the tofu in the egg and finally drag it in the pre-toasted breadcrumbs. \r\n5. Brush a bit of oil on the baking paper underneath the tofu and bake for about 10 minutes per side, flipping halfway thru.\r\n\r\nTo assemble:\r\n\r\n1. Cut a square of cling film slightly larger than your nori sheet. Place it on the table, place the nori sheet on top with the shiny side down and rotated 45\u00b0 in relation to the cling film.\r\n2. Wet your hands (keep a small bowl of water handy to wet your hands) and grab a handful of rice. Place it in the middle of the sheet and using your hands form it into a compacted square (about 9 cm \/ 3.5 \u201d by 9 cm \/ 3.5 \u201c). Try to make that layer as even and compacted as possible. Season well with salt. (Ideally, use an onigirazu mold.)\r\n3. Top with tofu, mayo, then veggies, and finally a second layer of rice.\r\n4. Fold the nori corners over the stack, using the cling film to help keep it together without tearing, until you get a small packet.\r\n5. Finally gather all the cling film over the stack and tie on the top. Put something moderately heavy (like a breadboard) on the onigirazu and set it aside to let the seaweed soften a little.

Place in the middle of the nori, then layer lettuce, radish, salmon, lettuce, and finally top with remaining rice.\r\n\r\nBring one corner of the nori to the center of the filling, then bring up the opposite corner. Be firm so that the nori closes well around the filling, but don't be so rough that the nori breaks. Repeat with remaining corners until they all meet in the center.\r\n\r\nWrap plastic wrap tightly around onigirazu. Refrigerate for a few minutes to soften the nori. Wet a sharp knife and cut onigirazu in half. Unwrap and enjoy.",

Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1\/2 cups flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.\r\n\r\n3. Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.\r\n\r\n5. Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12\" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.\r\n\r\n6. Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.\r\n\r\n7. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. \r\n\r\n8. Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.\r\nBake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.\r\n\r\n9. Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.\r\n\r\nYield: 4 12\" pizzas, 6 to 8 servings each.\r\nTo freeze: After dividing dough in step 5, wrap ball of dough in plastic wrap and freeze. Allow to defrost in refrigerator and then set out at room temperature for about 30 minutes before shaping crust.",

Cut off and discard the **squash** ends; using a knife, peel, then separate the neck and bulb. Halve the bulb; scoop out and discard the pulp and seeds, then medium dice the squash. Toss **apple** matchsticks with the juice of 1 **lemon wedge**.\r\n\r\n2. Make the filling: \r\nIn a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the **squash**; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned and tender. Add the **kale**, **spice blend** and **half the garlic**; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted. Add \u2153 of the **tomatoes**. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until well combined. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n3. Assemble the calzones:\r\nSprinkle **half the flour** onto a work surface. Divide the **dough** into 4 equal-sized portions; using your hands, gently stretch into \u00bc-inch-thick rounds. (If the dough is resistant, let rest for 5 minutes.) Divide the filling (you may have extra) between the rounds; top with the **Fontina cheese** and **half the Parmesan cheese**. Season with salt and pepper. Fold each round in half over the filling. Using your fingers or a fork, press or crimp the edges of the dough to seal.\r\n\r\n4. Bake the calzones:\r\nSprinkle the **remaining flour** onto a large sheet pan. Carefully transfer the calzones to the prepared sheet pan; lightly drizzle or brush the tops with olive oil. Bake 16 to 18 minutes, or until browned on top. Remove from the oven and let stand for 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.\r\n\r\n5. Make the tomato sauce:\r\nWhile the calzones bake, wipe out the pan used to make the filling. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and heat on medium until hot. Add the **remaining garlic** and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the **remaining tomatoes** and \u00bc cup of **water**. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened and saucy; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish.\r\n\r\n6. Make the salad & serve your dish:\r\nWhile the calzones continue to bake, to make the dressing, in a bowl, combine the **remaining Parmesan cheese** and the juice of the **remaining lemon wedges**. Slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons of olive oil until well combined; season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, in a bowl, combine the **arugula** and **apple**. Add enough of the dressing to coat (you may have extra). Toss to mix; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish. Serve with the baked calzones and tomato sauce. Enjoy!",

Stir gently. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes until noodles are cooked through, a bit past the al dente stage.\r\n\r\nDrain the noodles and rinse under cold water to cool quickly. Rinse until noodles are smooth and firm and not at all sticky. Allow noodle to drain in colander while the rest is being prepped.\r\n\r\nFor dipping sauce: combine dashi and kaeshi. Pack in a leak-proof container.\r\n\r\nFor crab salad: Massage the cabbage with the salt until the cabbage has wilted. Squeeze well to expel excess moisture. Put in a bowl, add the vinegar and sugar, and mix. Add the crab and taste; add a little more salt if needed. Sprinkle with sansho or black pepper.\r\n\r\nTo pack: Put the noodles in one compartment, sprinkle with green onion, keep nori and sesame seeds separate. Pack crab and cabbage salad in a divider cup. Halve egg and pack near noodles. Fill in any gaps with cherry tomatoes.",

        "instructions": "**To make the tangzhong:** Combine both the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.\r\n\r\nPlace the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly, until thickened, paste-like, and the spoon or spatula leaves lines on the bottom of the pan. This should take 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your burner.\r\n\r\nRemove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, the bowl of a stand mixer, or the bucket of a bread machine (whatever you plan to knead the dough in).\r\n\r\n**To make the dough:** Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the cold milk, then the flour and remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl in the order listed; the heat from the tangzhong will help to warm the cold milk.\r\n\r\nMix \u2014 by hand, on low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, or in a bread machine set to the dough cycle \u2014 to bring the dough together. Next, knead the dough until it\u2019s smooth, elastic, and tacky. This will take up to 15 minutes by hand, 10 to 12 minutes on medium-low speed of a mixer, or the length of the dough cycle in a bread machine.\r\n\r\nShape the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover.\r\n\r\nLet the dough rise until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 to 90 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen).\r\n\r\n**To make the filling:** While the dough is rising, put the melted butter into a medium bowl and add the remaining ingredients, stirring until the mixture is the texture of damp sand. Set aside.\r\n\r\nLightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper. \r\n\r\n**To assemble the rolls:** Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and press it into a 10\u201d x 12\u201d rectangle that\u2019s about 1\/2\u201d thick. For evenly shaped rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with corners), rather than an oval. \r\n\r\nSprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1\/2\u201d strip along one long side. \r\n\r\nStarting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log.\r\n\r\nScore the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1\/2\u201d to 2\u201d pieces; this will make large, saucer-sized cinnamon rolls \u2014 their generous size is part of their charm. Cut the dough at the score marks. Dental floss will give you the cleanest cut: pull off a long piece of floss, loop it underneath the log at the score mark, and pull the ends in opposite directions to cut the dough. Repeat until you've cut all of the rolls. If you don\u2019t have dental floss, a bench knife or sharp knife will work. \r\n\r\nPlace the rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them so there\u2019s at least 2\u201d between each one and they\u2019re 2\u201d away from the edges of the pan; a 3-2-3 arrangement works well. To prevent them from unraveling while they rise and bake, tuck the ends of the spirals underneath the rolls so that they\u2019re held in place.\r\n\r\nCover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let them rise for 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen). The rolls should be puffy and the dough shouldn\u2019t bounce back immediately when gently pressed.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 minutes before you\u2019re ready to bake, position a rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\r\n\r\nBake the rolls for 14 to 18 minutes, until they\u2019re a light golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one roll reads 190\u00b0F. Bake for the lesser amount of time for extra-soft rolls, and the longer amount of time for rolls with a bit more color and slightly firmer texture.\r\n\r\nRemove the rolls from the oven, place the pan on a rack, and brush the hot rolls with 1 1\/2 tablespoons (21g) of the melted butter. Let the rolls cool for 10 to 15 minutes before icing.\r\n\r\n**To make the icing:** Combine the remaining 1 1\/2 tablespoons (21g) melted butter with the remaining icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing with a spatula until smooth. Milk makes a lovely frosting; using cream in place of milk creates an extra layer of richness, while substituting buttermilk adds subtle tang, a nice counterpoint to the icing's overall sweetness.\r\n\r\nIce the rolls and serve immediately. If you\u2019re planning to serve the rolls later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature, tightly covered, until you\u2019re ready to use it.\r\n\r\nStore completely cooled rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month.",

With a spatula, flatten the rice into an even layer and allow it to cook undisturbed for about 5 minutes or until you see the rice become lightly golden. Add the garlic back on top of the rice with a pinch of salt and then break it up into chunks with your spatula.\r\n\r\nTo serve, layer the rice and plantains together then top with the black bean salad.

On each half, slit the core thru most of the way up, so the leaves are loose but still attached.\r\n\r\nOpening the leaves one by one, rub salt in, focusing on the thicker stem area. Close cabbage halves back up and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours, until the stems become tender\/floppy. (Don't let them sit too long and absorb too much salt.)\r\n\r\nSplit the cores along the slit so you have quarters. Rinse the salt off the leaves, then trim *most* of the core out, leaving just enough to keep the leaves together. (Or remove the core entirely, depending on how you want to present it.) Rinse again, and let drain.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMix the water, sugar, and flour in a small pot, and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until it's fully integrated and bubbling. Remove from heat, put in a large bowl, and let cool completely.\r\n\r\nOnce cooled, add all the spices and mix into a thin paste. Add the vegetables and mix well.\r\n\r\nRub the paste fully over each cabbage leaf. When a quarter is fully coated, wrap it around itself into a little packet, and put it into your storage container.\r\n\r\nLet the kimchi ferment at room temperature for a day or two. When ready, it will start to smell and taste sour, and release bubbles when pressed on. If using a sealed jar, remember to open it occasionally to release pressure. Move the container to the refrigerator to slow the fermentation, where it can be stored about two weeks. It will get more sour as time goes on.",

        "instructions": "Begin by making your scrambled eggs. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper until smooth. Heat a large saute pan that has been misted with cooking spray (or spread with a teaspoon of oil) on the skillet over medium heat, then add the eggs and cook for 4-\u00ad6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are scrambled and cooked through. Transfer to a separate plate and set aside.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, while your eggs are cooking, heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-\u00adhigh heat. Add onion and saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is mostly cooked and slightly translucent. Add the potatoes and bell peppers, and stir to combine. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, for 7\u00ad-10 more minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and cooked through. Stir in the black beans, green chiles, salt and cumin, and continue cooking for 2 more minutes. Then remove the mixture from the heat, and set aside.\r\n\r\nTo assemble your burritos, spread out a large sheet of plastic wrap on a flat surface and lay the tortilla squarely in the center of it. Add a large spoonful of scrambled eggs in the center of the tortilla (roughly 1\/4 cup), followed by another large spoonful of the potato mixture on top of the eggs, followed by a few tablespoons of shredded cheese on top of the potato mixture. Fold the two opposite sides of the tortilla in so that they meet and overlap, then fold in the two remaining open ends so that the entire burrito is sealed. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap so that the entire burrito is very tightly sealed. (I find it easiest to fold the plastic wrap over the two short ends, then the longer sides of the burrito.) Then transfer burritos to the freezer, where they will last for up to 3 months.\r\n\r\nTo thaw the frozen burritos, remove the plastic wrap and place a burrito on a microwave\u00adsafe plate. Microwave for 60-\u00ad90 seconds, or until warmed through. Serve plain or with salsa, for dipping.",

It might be a little stubborn, so just take your time and spread it as best you can \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Spoon the chia jam over the surface, and use a spatula or knife to spread it evenly, making sure to only go within 1\/4 of the edge to prevent the jam from burning. Top with remaining dough by dropping it on top in in a few separate globs, and then using your spatula to spread them out.\r\n\r\nBake for 35 \u2013 40 minutes, until the center has set and the bars begin to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

        "instructions": "Cook the rice using a little less water than usual. Fresh cooked rice is best for gimbap.\r\n\r\nCut the tofu into about 3\/4-inch thick sticks. Pat dry with a paper towel, and lightly sprinkle with salt. Heat a small pan with enough oil to cover the pan. Add the tofu pieces and fry until all sides are golden brown.\r\n\r\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the spinach, place immediately in the ice bath, then squeeze out the water. Cut into short lengths by running a knife through a few of times. Season with the sesame oil (about 1\/2 teaspoon) and salt.\r\n\r\nCut the cucumber into 1\/2-inch thick sticks. Do not use the seedy part. Heat the pan with a little bit of oil over medium high heat. Stir fry the cucumber until softened. Lightly season with salt.\r\n\r\nJulienne the carrots. Heat the pan with a little bit of oil over medium high heat. Stir fry the carrots until softened. Lightly season with salt.\r\n\r\nFor the burdock root, rinse the root. Cut into 2 long pieces. Scrape off the skin with a knife or the back of a knife. Cut each piece diagonally into thin slices. Gather a few thin slices at a time, and cut into match sticks. Heat a pan. Add the burdock root and a tablespoon of sesame oil or perilla seed oil. Stir-fry until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add water, the soy sauce, and agave syrup. Simmer over medium low heat until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 7 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds.\r\n\r\nWhen all the other ingredients are ready, remove the rice from the rice cooker. While the rice is still hot, add the sesame oil and salt. Mix well by gently folding with a rice paddle or large spoon until evenly seasoned. Add more salt to taste. The rice will cool down during this process and be ready to be used.\r\n\r\nPut a sheet of nori (gim), shiny side down and longer side toward you, on a cutting board or a bamboo mat if available. Spread about 3\/4 cup to 1 cup of rice evenly over the gim, using a rice paddle or your fingers preferably. Lay the prepared ingredients on top of the rice close to the side toward you.\r\n\r\nLift the entire bottom edge with both hands and roll over the filling away from you, tucking in the filling with your fingers. Put firm pressure over the roll with the help of the bamboo mat, if using, to close everything in tightly. Then, continue to roll again, putting pressure evenly over the roll using both hands.\r\n\r\nRub or brush the roll with a little bit of sesame oil for extra flavor and shiny look. Apply a little bit of sesame oil to a sharp knife. This will keep rice from sticking to the knife. Repeat as necessary after each cut. Wipe the knife with a damp towel if the rice still sticks. Cut the roll into 1\/2-inch thick bite sizes.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nMix 1 cup regular short grain rice with 1 cup short grain brown rice for a healthier option.\r\nAdapted from Temple Food of Venerable Seonjae",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425F. Place a box grater over a parchment-lined baking tray then grate the tofu over the largest holes of the box grater to create shreds. Top the shreds with cornstarch, paprika, coriander, garlic powder, tamari and oil. Toss to coat the tofu then spread it out in an even layer on the baking tray.\r\n\r\nTo a separate baking tray (if everything won't fit on one), add the cabbage, onions, garlic powder, coriander, thyme, a generous pinch of salt and the oil. Toss to evenly coat then spread the cabbage mix out in an even layer on the baking tray.\r\nPlace the tofu on the middle rack and the cabbage on the bottom rack in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes then give both trays a toss, spread them back out then place back in the oven (switching racks) for another 8-10 minutes until the tofu is golden and the cabbage starts to crisp around the edges.\r\n\r\nWhile the tofu and cabbage bake, combine the pistachios, parsley, mint, garlic, za\u2019atar, sumac, lemon zest and juice, maple syrup, oil and a generous pinch of salt together in a bowl then stir to combine.\r\nOnce the tofu and cabbage is done baking, transfer the cabbage to the tray of tofu and top with the pistachio mixture. Using tongs, toss the mixture together until evenly combined.\r\n\r\nWarm the pita according to package instructions then assemble your wrap. Spread 2-3 tbsp of hummus on the pita then top with some lettuce and the tofu mixture. Fold it together into a wrap then enjoy.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nUse super firm tofu for best results. This type of tofu compared with extra firm tofu is denser and shreds easier. Using extra firm tofu may result in the tofu crumbling.\r\n\r\nSave chopping time. Use bagged shredded cabbage or a coleslaw mix if you want to vary the veggies without the chopping. You can also shred cabbage using a mandolin if preferred.\r\n\r\nMake a pourable sauce using hummus. Mix together 3 tbsp of hummus with 2 tsp of lemon juice and 2 tbsp or more water, whisking together until at your desired consistency. Use it to pour over your tofu mix before wrapping it up.",

Drain, rinse under cold water until cool, then shake the colander to remove as much water as possible. Set aside.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nClean and grease the grates. Grill the tofu (closed if using a gas grill) until it releases from the grates and grill marks appear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Return the tofu to the bowl of dressing. While the tofu\u2019s grilling, grill the mushrooms, turning occasionally, until browned and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Return the mushrooms to the sheet pan and head back inside.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nTo the bowl of tofu, add the soba, snap peas, mushrooms, chile, sesame seeds and basil. Use your hands to toss gently.

Let stand for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.\r\n\r\nHeat grill to medium high.\r\n\r\nClean and oil cooking grate. Brush onion slices on both sides with oil. Grill tomato halves, onion slices, poblanos, and jalape\u00f1os on hotter side of grill (covered if using gas) until poblanos and jalape\u00f1os are well blistered all over, 5 to 10 minutes, and onion rounds and tomatoes are deep brown on both sides and just tender, 10 to 15 minutes, checking onions every 5 minutes and flipping and rotating as needed to ensure even cooking. (You may need to cook in batches.) As poblanos and jalape\u00f1os finish cooking, transfer to now-empty bowl, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and let sit until skins soften, about 5 minutes. Transfer onion rounds and tomato halves to cutting board as they finish cooking. \r\n\r\nTurn grill down to medium heat.\r\n\r\nRoughly chop onion rounds into 1\/4-inch pieces. Chop tomato into 1\/2-inch pieces (these will be soft and mushy, which is OK). Transfer both to a large bowl, including all tomato juices.\r\n\r\nUsing paper towels, peel away skin from peppers. Slice poblanos into 1\/4-inch-thick strips, discarding seeds as you slice. Thinly slice jalape\u00f1os crosswise into rounds and add both peppers to bowl with onions and tomatoes. Add black beans, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon lime juice,1 tablespoon minced cilantro, and 1\/4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Season with additional salt to taste (but be prudent as lots of salty cheese will be added.) In a separate bowl combine Monterey Jack, and cheddar cheeses.\r\n\r\nTo Assemble and Cook the Nachos: Spread 1\/3 of tortilla chips evenly in a 12-inch cast iron skillet or into bottom of a 9- by 13-inch disposable aluminum foil pan. Sprinkle with 1\/3 of vegetable mixture followed by 1\/3 cheese mixture. Repeat layering of chips and vegetable mixture and cheese mixture 2 more times, for a total of 3 layers with the cheese layer on top. Place skillet on cooler side of grill, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, 10 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle with scallions and cilantro and serve with lime wedges. Optionally, serve with dollops of sour cream and guacamole and salsa on the side.",

Work in the butter until it's evenly distributed; the mixture will be crumbly. Press the crust firmly into a parchment lined 8\" square pan. If the mixture begins to stick to your hands, chill in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, then continue to press into the pan. It's important that the crust is firmly anchored to the pan so no filling seeps underneath.\r\n\r\nBake the crust for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and reduce the oven temperature to 325\u00b0F.\r\n\r\nWhile the crust is baking, make the topping: Combine the whole eggs, egg yolk, and sugars and whisk until smooth. Add the flour and salt, then the lemon juice, and whisk until thoroughly combined.\r\n\r\nLet the filling sit for 15 minutes or so, until the bubbles (mostly) disappear.\r\n\r\nWhile the baked crust is still hot, pour the topping over it. Return the bars to the oven and bake until they appear set and relatively dry on top, about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nRemove the bars from the oven, and cool them on a rack. Let them cool completely before slicing. Just before serving, sprinkle the top of the bars with confectioners' sugar.\r\n\r\nStore any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to several (3 to 4) days.\r\n\r\nTips from our Bakers\r\nFor an extra hit of lemon flavor, stir the finely grated rind of 1 lemon into the crust dough before baking.",
